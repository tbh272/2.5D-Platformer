# 🚀 Basic 2.5D Platformer in Godot 🎮

Welcome to my **2.5D Platformer** project built in **Godot Engine**! 🌟 This is a very basic work-in-progress as I learn game development. I’m **no expert**—just someone experimenting, having fun, and growing as a developer. My goal is to create a simple starting point for anyone to **jump into Godot**, tweak this project, or **completely transform it** into something unique! 🛠️ Feel free to modify, enhance, or use it as inspiration—**it’s all yours** to play with! 😎

## ✨ Current Features

This 2.5D platformer is in its early stages but includes:

- 🏃‍♂️ **Basic Movement**: Simple player controls for running and jumping in a 2.5D environment.
- 🎨 **Placeholder Assets**: Using assets like the Adventurer Male sprite for the character and a test level object to set up the scene.
- 📜 **Minimal UI**: A basic main menu, and settings page to get started, with plans to expand it.

Right now, it’s super basic, but I’m planning to add features from my other projects, like advanced state machines, polished menus, to make it as robust and fun as my 3D platformer! 🚀

## 🛠️ Why This Project?

I’m learning Godot, and this 2.5D platformer is my sandbox for experimenting with 2.5D workflows. It’s a **simple foundation** for anyone wanting to:

- Get started with Godot’s 2.5D setup.
- Test basic movement and level design.
- Build upon a minimal project to add their own mechanics.

**You have my full permission** to take this project, break it, rebuild it, or use it however you want. My hope is to keep adding features (like combat, menus, and audio) to make it as feature-rich as my other projects while keeping it beginner-friendly. 🔥

## 📋 How to Get Started

1. **Clone or Download**: Grab this project from the repository.
2. **Open in Godot**: Built in **Godot 4.x**—import the project and start exploring!
3. **Explore & Tweak**: Check out the scenes, scripts, and nodes. Add your own mechanics or assets!
4. **Make It Yours**: Enhance the movement, build new levels, or turn it into something completely different. 🎨

This project is a learning journey, and I’m excited to keep building it out with features like those in my 3D platformer (combat, menus, audio, etc.). If you’re new to Godot, dive in and experiment.
